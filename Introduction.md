# Partner API
# Introduction to ING Business Banking Partner
ING Business Banking allows partners to submit applications on behalf of potential prospects.
A partner can start the onboarding through the page [partner werden](https://www.ing.de/business/partner-werden/).
After onboarded and signed the relevant contract and agreements a partner can apply on behalf of the prospect, through the antrag form that you can find [here.](https://openbusiness.ing.de/partner/firmenkredit)
and now we also offer a possibility to send applications programmatically through APIs.
This document aims to provide developers with an easy and quick way to make use of Partner API.
