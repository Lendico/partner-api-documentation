# Partner API
# Introduction to ING Business Banking Partner
ING Business Banking allows partners to submit applications on behalf of potential prospects.
A partner can start the onboarding through the page [partner werden](https://www.lendico.de/partner-werden).
After onboarded and signed the relevant contract and agreements a partner can apply on behalf of the prospect, through the antrag form that you can find it [here.](https://antrag.lendico.de/partner-antrag)
and now we also offer a possibility to send applications programmatically through APIs.
This document aims to provide developers with an easy and quick way to make use of Partner API.
